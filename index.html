	He grabbed me with his soggy fingers and said.. "Snap out of it, Man." 
	Then he proceeded to chant and walk in circles around me. 
	I looked down, My pants were still on fire, but by this time it had spread to my Uterus and three other ligaments. I was getting pretty agitated that no one seemed to care about my third degree burns, or my soon imminent death, but I went along with his plan still hoping he'd manage to save me through his voo-doo witchcraft. 
	After I came out of my trance from the fire I noticed that I was now in the kitchen of my grandma's house baking a cake..
